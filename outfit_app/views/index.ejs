                        Our YOLO model identifies different types of clothing in your wardrobe, quickly recognizing items and categorizing them into types like tops, bottoms, and shoes. This allows for efficient wardrobe management, making it easy to catalog your outfits with just a photo.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Our fine-tuned ResNet-18 model captures the unique characteristics of each clothing item, generating 512-dimensional embeddings that represent style, color, and pattern. These embeddings enable us to match and recommend items that align well with your fashion preferences.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, we determine the compatibility of outfit items by analyzing the relationships between ResNet-18 embeddings. The MLP learns which items complement each other, helping you create cohesive outfits that reflect your style.
